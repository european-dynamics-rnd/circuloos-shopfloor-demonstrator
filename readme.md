# CIRCULOOS Shopfloor Demo

The current repo is acollection of hardware and software compoment ment to simulate the jurney of the measurements of a shopfloor to a local RAMP IIoT instance (on a RasberyPi) and on the centalazed CIRCULOOS Data platform.
The demo consist of a full end to end solution ie from the sensor to the communication inside the shopfloor to the local RAMP IIoT instance and to the centalazed CIRCULOOS Data platform.


## Measurements
The following measurements (from various sensors) are included:
- Air temperature (BME680)
- Air hummidity (BME680)
- Air presure (BME680)
- Surface temperature (Pt100, k-type thermocuple)
- Inductive proximity sensor
- Weight
- Colour


## Shopfloor communication protocols 
The following communication protocols are incuded:
- CAN
- RS485 
- MQTT 
- I2C
